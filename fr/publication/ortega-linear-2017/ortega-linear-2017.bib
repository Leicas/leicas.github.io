 abstract = {This article describes the design of a high-fidelity haptic interface based on a three-axis induction system. Unlike other type of actuators, linear induction motors can provide simultaneously a non-contact drive and a very low inertia. Their integration in a haptic device enables an interface with quasiperfect mechanical transparency. We detail the conception of linear induction motors for a haptic application and experimental results of a proof-of-concept interface driven by them are shown.},
