 abstract = {We describe the graduate-level CanHap 501 (wiki.canhaptics.ca) course, an introduction to the inception, creation and evaluation of haptic and multimodal human-computer interfaces. The course covers perceptual and attentional foundations, and emphasizes control and/or display of computed sensations and environments through haptic devices to users' sense of touch for the purpose of haptic communicationâ€” e.g., signalling, social and affective touch, and sharing of control between humans and smart systems.},
