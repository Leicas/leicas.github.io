Que vous gériez des e-mails pour une petite entreprise ou une grande organisation, comprendre ces concepts fondamentaux vous aidera à améliorer la délivrabilité, la sécurité et les performances générales.\nCe guide couvre les aspects essentiels de la livraison des e-mails, du protocole SMTP basique aux méthodes avancées d’authentification et aux stratégies de gestion de réputation. Des analogies simples vous aideront à comprendre des concepts complexes, accompagnées de recommandations pratiques.\nPrincipes du protocole SMTP Le protocole SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) constitue la base de l’envoi des e-mails. C’est un protocole de communication pour la transmission du courrier électronique, fonctionnant comme un service postal d’internet.\nLorsque vous envoyez un e-mail, votre client de messagerie se connecte à un serveur SMTP via le port TCP 25, 587 ou 465 (SSL/TLS). Le client fournit à ce serveur l’expéditeur, le destinataire et le contenu du message.\nLe serveur SMTP décide ensuite comment acheminer le message, en consultant les enregistrements MX (Mail Exchange) du domaine destinataire via DNS.\nCommandes SMTP essentielles : HELO/EHLO : identifie le serveur envoyeur MAIL FROM : indique l’adresse de l’expéditeur RCPT TO : indique l’adresse du destinataire DATA : commence l’envoi du contenu QUIT : termine la session Authentification des e-mails Les protocoles d’authentification aident à vérifier l’identité des expéditeurs et à protéger contre l’usurpation et le phishing. Voici les trois méthodes principales illustrées avec l’analogie classique d’« Alice et Bob ».\nSPF (Sender Policy Framework) Le SPF est comme une liste d’invités autorisés pour envoyer des mails au nom de votre domaine.\nFonctionnement : le propriétaire du domaine publie une liste des serveurs autorisés via un enregistrement TXT DNS.\nAvantages :\nFacilité d’implémentation Empêche l’usurpation directe Large compatibilité Inconvénients :\nNe vérifie pas le contenu Problème lors du transfert Pas de rapport détaillé DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) Le DKIM est comparable à un sceau numérique sur une enveloppe, permettant de vérifier l’intégrité du message avec une clé publique DNS.\nFonctionnement : une signature numérique ajoutée à l’entête du mail est vérifiée par le serveur destinataire via DNS.\nAvantages :\nVérifie l’intégrité du contenu Résiste au transfert Sécurité cryptographique Inconvénients :\nComplexe à implémenter Pas de rapport intégré Ne protège pas totalement contre l’usurpation DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting \u0026amp; Conformance) DMARC relie SPF et DKIM en précisant comment agir en cas d’échec d’authentification, tout en offrant un système de reporting.\nFonctionnement : précise les actions en cas d’échec SPF ou DKIM, avec rapports.\nAvantages :\nReporting intégré Application claire des règles Combine SPF et DKIM Inconvénients :\nNécessite SPF et DKIM configurés Complexité supplémentaire Surveillance continue Pourquoi utiliser les trois ? SPF vérifie les serveurs autorisés. DKIM assure intégrité et authenticité. DMARC applique les politiques et rapporte. Ensemble, ils renforcent considérablement la sécurité et la délivrabilité.\nDNS et hiérarchie de domaine Le DNS (Domain Name System) est crucial, agissant comme un annuaire internet traduisant les noms de domaine en adresses IP.\nHiérarchie DNS (droite vers gauche) : Racine : “.” TLD : .com, .org, .net ccTLD : .ca, .uk Domaines secondaires : example.co Sous-domaines : mail.example.co Enregistrements DNS pour e-mails : MX : serveurs mails du domaine TXT : SPF, DKIM, DMARC A/AAAA : associe noms et adresses IP PTR : DNS inversé (IP vers nom d’hôte) Ces enregistrements garantissent routage et authentification corrects.\nTypes d’e-mails Différents types d’e-mails nécessitent des stratégies variées :\nE-mails transactionnels Déclenchés par actions spécifiques Priorité élevée Attendus par les destinataires (ex.: confirmations d’achat) E-mails de notification Notifications modérées Semi-attendus (ex.: notifications de tâches) E-mails marketing Contenu promotionnel Envoyés en masse Moins prioritaires (ex.: newsletters) E-mails d’affaires courants Communication quotidienne Personnalisés et conversationnels (ex.: échanges clients) Stratégie de séparation des domaines Utilisez des domaines séparés pour préserver votre réputation principale :\nDomaine principal (example.co) : affaires courantes, e-mails transactionnels Domaine secondaire (marketing.example.com) : marketing, newsletters Réputation du serveur La réputation du serveur influence fortement la délivrabilité, comme un « score de crédit » pour l’IP et le domaine.\nFacteurs clés : Plaintes spam Taux de rebond Présence sur liste noire Une mauvaise réputation affecte la délivrabilité globale.\nRecommandations d’implémentation Configurez SPF, DKIM et DMARC sur votre domaine principal.

MMT is often case-specific, and requires underlying latency distributions to be known. We propose a novel approach – which we refer to as the DelayRIM – which uses the timestepping aspect of a Reduced Interface Model for the virtual environment to render an up-to-date force to the haptic device from the delayed information. RIM is applicable to any physical system, and the DelayRIM itself makes no underlying assumption about the latency distribution. We show that for realistic variable delays, the DelayRIM improves transparency compared to other methods.","tags":["Delays","Force","Haptic interfaces","Haptics","Jacobian matrices","Mathematical models","Model-mediated teleoperation","Multi-user study","Predictive models","Reduced interface model","Variable time delay","Virtual environments"],"title":"Haptic Interactions Subject to Variable Latency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antoine Weill--Duflos","Maciej Lacki","Colin GALLACHER"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1706388498,"objectID":"6e8e4bfe3bbd042cd1f44c3e133ca65e","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/weill-duflos-haptic-2023/","publishdate":"2024-01-27T19:18:16.815312Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/weill-duflos-haptic-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Braking device","Coupled","Haptic","Housing","Transmission"],"title":"Haptic Braking Device and Parallel Hybrid Actuator System Using Same","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colin GALLACHER","Felix DESOURDY","Oliver Philbin-Briscoe","Antoine Weill--Duflos","Maciej Lacki","Nicholas Ong","Jessica Henry","Yi Ding"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1696118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1706388498,"objectID":"c8ed5b67746bf97b971fa445a1e58bb1","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/gallacher-apparatus-2023/","publishdate":"2024-01-27T19:18:16.785238Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/gallacher-apparatus-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Exemplary","Link","Linkage","Relative","Tool"],"title":"Apparatus and Method for Tracking Motion and Providing Haptic Feedback","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felix DESOURDY","Dylan SAWATZKY","Antoine Weill--Duflos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1706388498,"objectID":"feb9102e7640a7c82e91d135daa57550","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/desourdy-capstan-2023/","publishdate":"2024-01-27T19:18:16.771226Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/desourdy-capstan-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Along","Cable","Force","Jamming","Tension"],"title":"Capstan Drive Transmission Self-Tensioning Apparatus and Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maurício Fontana de Vargas","David Marino","Antoine Weill--Duflos","Jeremy R.

The occurrences are documented in the case of hearing, smell, taste, sight, and certain modalities of the sense of touch. For example, it is well known that our eyes adjust between darker and brighter environments. We are specifically interested in the case of sensory adaptation in the kinaesthetic system and the way it applies to forces. We make the hypothesis of the existence of kinaesthetic sensory adaptation. The specific hypothesis is that instead of knowing the absolute magnitude of a force we are sensitive to changes. To determine the existence of sensory adaptation to forces as well as its properties we led a pilot and two experiments. The experiments involved 58 participants, 48 participant's results were analyzed. From the results, we were able to find the proof of a form of sensory adaptation to kinaesthetic feedback. This phenomenon can be seen as a high-pass filter with a time constant of 14 s. These findings can find application in algorithms to reduce the energy needed for force feedback devices by slowly decreasing the force, similarly to the wash-out filter in motion simulators.","tags":["haptics"],"title":"Evidence of Sensory Adaptation to Kinaesthetic Sensations in the Human Somatosensory System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Parisa Alirezaee","Antoine Weill--Duflos","Joseph J.

This has motivated research aimed at shifting the delivery of physiological vital sign information and annunciation of alarm events from visual and auditory devices to haptic transducers. We compare performance in perceiving and identifying the specific type and level of a vital sign that has entered a high or low state, i.e., an alarm event, using several designs of a vibrotactile display, against that of the traditional auditory alarm in conjunction with a graphical patient monitor. A distractor activity was used to simulate competing task demands in the clinical environment. Responses were assessed with respect to response time and accuracy. With sufficient anatomical separation of the actuators, certain vibrotactile information rendering strategies demonstrated performance that was not significantly different from that of the baseline condition, both in response time and accuracy. We conclude that vibrotactile delivery of patient vitals can support alarm-state vital sign identification competitive with graphical and auditory alarm display conditions, without significantly impacting performance on a parallel attention-demanding activity. This suggests the possibility of improving high-impact healthcare environments by replacing disturbing auditory alarms with vibrotactile information delivery to clinicians.","tags":["haptics"],"title":"Exploring the Effectiveness of Haptic Alarm Displays for Critical Care Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antoine Weill--Duflos","Pascal E.

By using a custom speech to haptics synthesis framework, this paper presents results from a user study investigating the influence of haptic speech enhancement on speaker's characteristic perception. A custom speech to haptic system is used to first replicate a study from Klofstad et al. examining how voice pitch influences perception of speaker strength, competence and trustworthiness, and second to explore the impact of multimodal stimulus presentation on these perceived characteristics. Our preliminary findings suggest that the perceived strength of a speaker with a higher voice pitch is enhanced, whereas the outcome is uncertain for competence. Perceived trustworthiness was not affected by the system at all.

This is likely due to their reported susceptibility to erroneous perception of haptic stimuli, owing to their anatomical structure.

Our efforts to design such an encoding achieved an improved perceptual accuracy of 18% for poking and 16% for vibrotactile stimuli. As we demonstrate, in this article, the resulting perceptual accuracy achieved by the proposed tactile encoding approaches that of the fingers, allowing for consideration of the toes as a practical location to render multi-site haptic stimuli.","tags":["haptics"],"title":"Ten Little Fingers, Ten Little Toes: Can Toes Match Fingers for Haptic Discrimination?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"At present, the operating room (OR) and intensive care unit (ICU) are noisy environments, exacerbated by frequent alarms.

This work is the first step toward new dynamic measuring capabilities and sensing at the micro/nano-scales when high dynamic, large measurement range and nanoNewton resolution are required.","tags":["Actuators","Mathematical model","feedback","feedback control","microsensors","control oriented electromechanical model","differential comb drive actuation","dynamic operating modes","electromechanical effects","experimental characterization","folded-flexure type suspensions","force balancing principle","force measurement","force sensors","frequency 2.2 kHz","high dynamic measurement range","large measurement range","linear force-voltage relationship","mechanical characterization","Mechanical sensors","microactuators","Micromechanical devices","nanoNewton resolution","passive sensors","Sensor phenomena and characterization","static operating modes","static passive measurement range","stroboscopic measurement system","Suspensions"],"title":"Modeling and Experimental Characterization of an Active MEMS Based Force Sensor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antoine Weill--Duflos","Sinan Haliyo","Stéphane Régnier","Vincent Hayward"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1516115095,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1706388498,"objectID":"9ada008cdb42c786d3a22be620bb1aaa","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/2018-br-4668/","publishdate":"2019-10-16T11:04:55-04:00","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/2018-br-4668/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Interface Haptique à Adaptation de Perception","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antoine Weill--Duflos","Sinan Haliyo","Stéphane Régnier","Vincent Hayward"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514819109,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1706388498,"objectID":"5d173e9682246a439651bef13dce7cf9","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/2018-br-4560/","publishdate":"2019-10-16T11:05:09-04:00","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/2018-br-4560/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Capteur de force sans raideur mécanique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feras Al Taha","Pascal E Fortin","Antoine Weill--Duflos","Jeremy R Cooperstock"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1706388498,"objectID":"0eb22b70aed9896991e1a2527757ad38","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/al-taha-reversing-2018/","publishdate":"2019-10-29T01:20:49.792118Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/al-taha-reversing-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Biased perceptions of others are known to negatively influence the outcomes of social and professional interactions in many regards. Theses biases can be informed by a multitude of non-verbal cues such as voice pitch and voice volume. This project explores how haptic effects, generated from speech, could attenuate listeners' perceived voice-related biases formed from a speaker's voice pitch. Promising preliminary results collected during a decision-making task suggest that the speech to haptic mapping and vibration delivery mechanism employed does attenuate voice-related biases. Accordingly, it is anticipated that such a system could be introduced in the workplace to equalize people's contribution opportunities and to create a more inclusive environment by reversing voice-related biases.","tags":["haptics","speech","affective computing","social computing"],"title":"Reversing Voice-Related Biases Through Haptic Reinforcement","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1508173529,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1572213226,"objectID":"d60d8a6dd504b93f371bc98783f05283","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/project/haptic-micro-teleoperation/","publishdate":"2017-10-16T13:05:29-04:00","relpermalink":"/fr/project/haptic-micro-teleoperation/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["haptic","micro-robotic"],"title":"Haptic Micro Teleoperation","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1508173227,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1572213226,"objectID":"ec8aa070008cbb70f1d07d45c47846e3","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/project/force-sensors/","publishdate":"2017-10-16T13:00:27-04:00","relpermalink":"/fr/project/force-sensors/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["micro-robotic"],"title":"Force Sensors","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1508173222,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1572213226,"objectID":"8bc59841cc1b12b13ea2932d6c8576e2","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/project/high-fidelity-haptic-devices/","publishdate":"2017-10-16T13:00:22-04:00","relpermalink":"/fr/project/high-fidelity-haptic-devices/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["haptic"],"title":"High Fidelity Haptic Devices","type":"project"},{"authors":["Antoine Weill--Duflos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1706388498,"objectID":"47c05ac3a880e73b1294a47f73cee299","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/weill-duflos-interfaces-2017/","publishdate":"2019-10-29T01:20:49.791117Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/weill-duflos-interfaces-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Teleoperation opens up new possibilities for interaction with the micro-world. Adequate systems make it possible for human to manipulate elements on microscopic scales. An added haptic feedback provides information crucial for a natural interaction. A bilateral coupling between the subsystems offers the best haptic transparency. This thesis addresses the design of a complete haptic teleoperation chain by focusing on its key elements. Three parts are detailed: The first part describes improvements of the high fidelity one degree of freedom haptic interface designed previously. First, the precision of the forces produced is improved. This improvement is related to the measurement of the motor velocity at high sampling frequencies. Then, the device is precisely caracterized. The second part describes the design of two new force sensors designed specifically for interactions with the micro-world. The forces are measured by compensation. Two approach are observed to expand the frequencies of forces measurable by the sensors. First approach try to reduce the mass, a new sensor on a micrometric scale is built with MEMS technologies. The second approach offer a new design of the sensor. In particular, the stiffness in the guidance is removed. The third part describes the design of a new haptic interface with multiple degrees of freedom. This interface combines the performances of the one degree of freedom interface with a 2D configuration. The key elements of its design are the an air bearing for frictionless guidance and linear induction motors for reduced inertia.","tags":["Haptic device","Capteur de force","Capteurs de force","Couplage bilatéral","Force sensor","Interface haptique","Micro-Monde","Microscopie","Microscopy","Robotique","Systèmes microélectromécaniques","Télécommande","Téléopéation"],"title":"Sensors and devices for a micro-teleoperation system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antoine Weill--Duflos","Guillaume Millet","Sinan Haliyo","Stéphane Régnier","Vincent Hayward"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1496588679,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1706388498,"objectID":"6f2f1da2d01bf050966b5679a8f1b203","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/hayward-high-fidelity-2017/","publishdate":"2019-10-16T11:04:39-04:00","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/hayward-high-fidelity-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"High Fidelity Haptic Device","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Ortega","Antoine Weill--Duflos","Sinan Haliyo","Stéphane Régnier","Vincent Hayward"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1706388498,"objectID":"9948b31290a5fb8075f141a2cbd57b08","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/ortega-linear-2017/","publishdate":"2019-10-29T01:20:49.785118Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/ortega-linear-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"This article describes the design of a high-fidelity haptic interface based on a three-axis induction system.

A particular attention is given to the choice of encoder. Compact, consumer grade, but low resolution encoders are particularly used. An issue arising from this particularity is the deterioration of the velocity measurement when Finite Difference method is used. Moreover, when encoders resolution decreases, velocity estimation becomes noisy. From haptic point of view, this noise destroys the realism of the rendered force. To deal with this problem, numerous methods have been proposed to offer a noiseless estimation. Here, advanced methods such as Low-Pass Filter, First Order Adaptive Windowing, Kalman Filter are proposed. Performances of theses methods are verified and experimentally compared to a conventional finite difference method. Here, we show that Kalman filter and First Order Adaptive Windowing offers a good trade-off between estimation and noise rejection.","tags":["Estimation","Finite difference methods","Force","Haptic interfaces","Kalman filter","Kalman filters","Mathematical model","Noise","Torque","Velocity measurement","dual-stage haptic device","encoders resolution","finite difference method","first order adaptive windowing","low resolution encoders","low-pass filter","low-pass filters","noise rejection","optimisation","rendered force","transparency optimization","velocity estimation","own"],"title":"Optimizing Transparency of Haptic Device through Velocity Estimation","type":"publication"}]
