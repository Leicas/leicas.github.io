The occurrences are documented in the case of hearing, smell, taste, sight, and certain modalities of the sense of touch. For example, it is well known that our eyes adjust between darker and brighter environments. We are specifically interested in the case of sensory adaptation in the kinaesthetic system and the way it applies to forces. We make the hypothesis of the existence of kinaesthetic sensory adaptation. The specific hypothesis is that instead of knowing the absolute magnitude of a force we are sensitive to changes. To determine the existence of sensory adaptation to forces as well as its properties we led a pilot and two experiments. The experiments involved 58 participants, 48 participant's results were analyzed. From the results, we were able to find the proof of a form of sensory adaptation to kinaesthetic feedback. This phenomenon can be seen as a high-pass filter with a time constant of 14 s. These findings can find application in algorithms to reduce the energy needed for force feedback devices by slowly decreasing the force, similarly to the wash-out filter in motion simulators.","tags":["haptics"],"title":"Evidence of Sensory Adaptation to Kinaesthetic Sensations in the Human Somatosensory System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Parisa Alirezaee","Antoine Weill--Duflos","Joseph J.

This has motivated research aimed at shifting the delivery of physiological vital sign information and annunciation of alarm events from visual and auditory devices to haptic transducers. We compare performance in perceiving and identifying the specific type and level of a vital sign that has entered a high or low state, i.e., an alarm event, using several designs of a vibrotactile display, against that of the traditional auditory alarm in conjunction with a graphical patient monitor. A distractor activity was used to simulate competing task demands in the clinical environment. Responses were assessed with respect to response time and accuracy. With sufficient anatomical separation of the actuators, certain vibrotactile information rendering strategies demonstrated performance that was not significantly different from that of the baseline condition, both in response time and accuracy. We conclude that vibrotactile delivery of patient vitals can support alarm-state vital sign identification competitive with graphical and auditory alarm display conditions, without significantly impacting performance on a parallel attention-demanding activity. This suggests the possibility of improving high-impact healthcare environments by replacing disturbing auditory alarms with vibrotactile information delivery to clinicians.","tags":["haptics"],"title":"Exploring the Effectiveness of Haptic Alarm Displays for Critical Care Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antoine Weill--Duflos","Pascal E.

By using a custom speech to haptics synthesis framework, this paper presents results from a user study investigating the influence of haptic speech enhancement on speaker's characteristic perception. A custom speech to haptic system is used to first replicate a study from Klofstad et al. examining how voice pitch influences perception of speaker strength, competence and trustworthiness, and second to explore the impact of multimodal stimulus presentation on these perceived characteristics. Our preliminary findings suggest that the perceived strength of a speaker with a higher voice pitch is enhanced, whereas the outcome is uncertain for competence. Perceived trustworthiness was not affected by the system at all. This work puts forward the potential positive effect that the use of haptic-enhanced communication system could have in social and professional communications, but also outlines its limitations.","tags":null,"title":"Haptic Augmentation of Audio and Its Effects on Speech Perception","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juliette Regimbal","Nusaiba Radi","Antoine Weill--Duflos","Jeremy R.

This is likely due to their reported susceptibility to erroneous perception of haptic stimuli, owing to their anatomical structure.

Our efforts to design such an encoding achieved an improved perceptual accuracy of 18% for poking and 16% for vibrotactile stimuli. As we demonstrate, in this article, the resulting perceptual accuracy achieved by the proposed tactile encoding approaches that of the fingers, allowing for consideration of the toes as a practical location to render multi-site haptic stimuli.","tags":["haptics"],"title":"Ten Little Fingers, Ten Little Toes: Can Toes Match Fingers for Haptic Discrimination?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1570906519,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1572213226,"objectID":"d8354f1b3e80815d6b231c52b623d6bc","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/project/3dprintedillusions/","publishdate":"2019-10-12T14:55:19-04:00","relpermalink":"/fr/project/3dprintedillusions/","section":"project","summary":"We propose a series of haptic illusions and demonstrations that can be fabricated using any FDM 3D printer.

This project involves the design of haptic devices to help in this process of sensory reeducation, which can involve two phases, depending on the severity of the loss of sensitivity: relearning how to localize sensations, and differentiation of shapes and textures in the identification of objects.","tags":["haptic","medical"],"title":"Haptic device for sensory reeducation","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1570906492,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1572213226,"objectID":"aca97b10c29eeb68bb85b59783ff58e5","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/project/wearablehaptics/","publishdate":"2019-10-12T14:54:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/fr/project/wearablehaptics/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["haptic"],"title":"Wearable Haptic devices","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The tactile sense can be used as a channel for general communication, especially in contexts where the visual and auditory modalities are occupied with other tasks or compromised.

We summarize key issues for practitioners to take into account when designing and carrying out in-the-wild wearable haptic user studies, as well as for user studies in a lab environment that seek to simulate real-world conditions. We include not only examples from published work and commercial sources, but also hard-won illustrative examples derived from issues and failures from our own haptic studies. By providing a broad-based, accessible overview of recurring issues, we expect that both novice and experienced haptic researchers will find suggestions that will improve their own mobile wearable haptic studies.","tags":["Actuators","Haptic interfaces","vibrotactile","Skin","Vibrations","Wearable haptics","haptic assessment","Hardware","in-the-wild studies","Special issues and sections","tactile perception","Usability"],"title":"Getting Your Hands Dirty Outside the Lab: A Practical Primer for Conducting Wearable Vibrotactile Haptics Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maurício Fontana de Vargas","Antoine Weill--Duflos","Jeremy R Cooperstock"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1596038349,"objectID":"b69de09a9006c22445dcec075c1277d1","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/de-vargas-haptic-2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-29T01:20:49.800118Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/de-vargas-haptic-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The tactile sense can be used as a channel for general communication, especially in contexts where the visual and auditory modalities are occupied with other tasks or compromised.

Adequate systems make it possible for human to manipulate elements on microscopic scales. An added haptic feedback provides information crucial for a natural interaction. A bilateral coupling between the subsystems offers the best haptic transparency. This thesis addresses the design of a complete haptic teleoperation chain by focusing on its key elements. Three parts are detailed: The first part describes improvements of the high fidelity one degree of freedom haptic interface designed previously. First, the precision of the forces produced is improved. This improvement is related to the measurement of the motor velocity at high sampling frequencies. Then, the device is precisely caracterized. The second part describes the design of two new force sensors designed specifically for interactions with the micro-world. The forces are measured by compensation. Two approach are observed to expand the frequencies of forces measurable by the sensors. First approach try to reduce the mass, a new sensor on a micrometric scale is built with MEMS technologies. The second approach offer a new design of the sensor. In particular, the stiffness in the guidance is removed. The third part describes the design of a new haptic interface with multiple degrees of freedom. This interface combines the performances of the one degree of freedom interface with a 2D configuration. The key elements of its design are the an air bearing for frictionless guidance and linear induction motors for reduced inertia.","tags":["Haptic device","Capteur de force","Capteurs de force","Couplage bilatéral","Force sensor","Interface haptique","Micro-Monde","Microscopie","Microscopy","Robotique","Systèmes microélectromécaniques","Télécommande","Téléopéation"],"title":"Sensors and devices for a micro-teleoperation system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antoine Weill--Duflos","Guillaume Millet","Sinan Haliyo","Stéphane Régnier","Vincent Hayward"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1496588679,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1596038349,"objectID":"6f2f1da2d01bf050966b5679a8f1b203","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/hayward-high-fidelity-2017/","publishdate":"2019-10-16T11:04:39-04:00","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/hayward-high-fidelity-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"High Fidelity Haptic Device","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Ortega","Antoine Weill--Duflos","Sinan Haliyo","Stéphane Régnier","Vincent Hayward"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1596038349,"objectID":"9948b31290a5fb8075f141a2cbd57b08","permalink":"https://antoine.weill-duflos.fr/fr/publication/ortega-linear-2017/","publishdate":"2019-10-29T01:20:49.785118Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/ortega-linear-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"This article describes the design of a high-fidelity haptic interface based on a three-axis induction system.

A particular attention is given to the choice of encoder. Compact, consumer grade, but low resolution encoders are particularly used. An issue arising from this particularity is the deterioration of the velocity measurement when Finite Difference method is used. Moreover, when encoders resolution decreases, velocity estimation becomes noisy. From haptic point of view, this noise destroys the realism of the rendered force. To deal with this problem, numerous methods have been proposed to offer a noiseless estimation. Here, advanced methods such as Low-Pass Filter, First Order Adaptive Windowing, Kalman Filter are proposed. Performances of theses methods are verified and experimentally compared to a conventional finite difference method. Here, we show that Kalman filter and First Order Adaptive Windowing offers a good trade-off between estimation and noise rejection.","tags":["Estimation","Finite difference methods","Force","Haptic interfaces","Kalman filter","Kalman filters","Mathematical model","Noise","Torque","Velocity measurement","dual-stage haptic device","encoders resolution","finite difference method","first order adaptive windowing","low resolution encoders","low-pass filter","low-pass filters","noise rejection","optimisation","rendered force","transparency optimization","velocity estimation","own"],"title":"Optimizing Transparency of Haptic Device through Velocity Estimation","type":"publication"}]
