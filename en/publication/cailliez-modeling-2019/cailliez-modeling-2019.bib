 abstract = {Active force sensors are based on the principle of force balancing using a feedback control. They allow, unlike passive sensors, the static characterization of forces without interference of the sensor mechanical properties on the estimated stiffness of the object to be studied. This capability is fundamental when dealing with the mechanical characterization of samples having a wide range of stiffness. This paper deals with the modeling and the experimental characterization of a new active MEMS based force sensor. This sensor includes folded-flexure type suspensions and a differential comb drive actuation allowing a linear force/voltage relationship. A control oriented electromechanical model is proposed and validated experimentally in static and dynamic operating modes using a stroboscopic measurement system. This work is a first step towards new MEMS active force sensor with high resonant frequency ($>$2kHz) and high linear measurement force range (50 $μ$N). The advantage of this structure is to be able to change the sensor operating point without changing the sensor dynamics. Thus simplifying the control law. Modifying the operating point allows performing an accurate self positioning of the probe in close proximity to the surface to be studied.},
