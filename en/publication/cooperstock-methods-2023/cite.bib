 abstract = {Methods and systems for controlling a haptic display are provided. Data associated with first and second data types is obtained, the data defining values for the first and second data types. The first and second data types are associated to first and second vibration features of the haptic display, respectively, the second vibration feature different from the first vibration feature. A vibration pattern comprising a plurality of vibration pulses representing the first and second vibration features within a common time interval is produced on the haptic display, wherein the first vibration feature is expressed based on the values of the data for the first data type and the second vibration feature is expressed based on the values of the data for the second data type.},
